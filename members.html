        <h2>UCHIHA ITACHI</h2>
        <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu
          Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger
          brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose
          activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge
          their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than
          they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain
          a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</p>

        <h2>death of ITACHI</h2>
        <p>In 2009, Itachi died in the anime after a climactic battle with Sasuke, wherein he gives Sasuke his Sharingan
          power. Having been wracked by guilt, Itachi had always known that the only way he could meet his end was by
          Sasuke’s hand. In fact, Itachi went so far as to make himself seem dastardly and evil, so that when Sasuke
          would go on to kill him, Sasuke would be seen as a hero.</p>

        <h2>WHO USES ITACHI?</h2>
        <p>The complexity of Itachi’s character inspired much discussion about him, especially in online fandom. As the
          series progressed, fans often wondered what Itachi’s motives were. For example, in the beginning of the
          series, fans wondered why Itachi would kill his entire clan. Some wondered why Itachi would even stay in the
          Akatsuki, as his goals might be misaligned with theirs. His relationship with his brother Sasuke was a driving
          force of the series, making it a focal point of discussion in the fandom as well. After the revelation of his
          true motivations behind murdering his clan, Itachi was seen as a more sympathetic character, and their
          relationship was viewed as tragic.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Infant_Sasuke_and_Itachi.webp" alt="">
        Itachi was the first child born to Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha. His early childhood was marked with violence: when
        he was four years old, the Third Shinobi World War waged and he witnessed first-hand many of the war's
        casualties. The death and destruction he experienced at such a young age traumatised Itachi and made him a
        pacifist leading to him training non-stop to achieve his dream of becoming a ninja among ninja in order to erase
        fighting from the world. At age 5, after becoming a big brother to Sasuke, Itachi was approached by Shisui, who
        offered to train together. Soon, the two became best friends, forming a brother-like bond as they continued to
        teach the other new tricks. During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, he was home alone looking after Sasuke,
        followed by Itachi rescuing Mikoto from falling debris, and in the anime seeking shelter with Izumi.The
        Nine-Tails' attack had soured relations between Konoha's leadership and the Uchiha, the former believing the
        latter to be responsible. The Uchiha were relocated to the edge of the village, isolating them from the rest of
        the village and making it easier to monitor them.</p>
      <p>
        At age 6, Itachi enrolled into the Academy, where he consistently scored the highest in each subject and quickly
        learned any skill taught to him, resulting in him being praised as the best of his generation. After four
        months, his teachers unanimously agreed let him take the graduation exam early due to Itachi being more than
        advanced enough for genin-level, which he passed later that month. During this time, he began seriously studying
        the history of the world, gaining a great appreciation for it. On the day he graduated as the youngest post-war
        graduate, he was approached by Danzō Shimura, who assessed Itachi's thinking.

      </p>
      <p>
        Joining Team 2, Itachi went on to honing his skills to chūnin level, leading to him drawing the attention of
        Konoha's leaders. Meeting the criteria, Fugaku allowed him to sit in on clan meetings in the Naka Shrine
        basement. Nearly a year since graduating, Itachi had mastered ninjutsu to the extent his missions went too easy,
        though Yūki Minazuki didn't recommend him for the Chūnin Exams. After turning eight, as Team 2's genin had
        distinguished themselves the most during the year, they were tasked with guarding the Fire Daimyō during his
        annual trip to Konoha. During the mission, the convoy was attacked by a masked individual, who killed Tenma
        Izumo before Itachi, resulting in him awakening his Sharingan, which he mastered at the same age. In the anime,
        Itachi accompanied his friend Shisui on a three-part training exercise, only to interrupt a battle between the
        Third Hokage's Anbu and Root. After having driven out the Root ninja, Itachi learned from Shisui about having
        his own sense of morals from various viewpoints instead of one. At age 10, Konoha officials allowed Itachi to
        compete in the Chūnin Exams by himself, which he passed and became a chūnin.

      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Uchiha_Anbu.webp" alt="">
        At age 11, Itachi joined the Anbu as its youngest member. In the anime, Itachi is assigned to Team Ro, working
        alongside Tenzo and with Kakashi Hatake as his captain. During his mentorship, Itachi became acquainted with
        Kakashi and showed interest in the Sharingan he possessed despite not being an Uchiha. At one point, they both
        worked together in a two-man squad following an exchange between Konohagakure and the Prajñā Group of the Land
        of Woods; killing the latter party after an attempted betrayal. They would work together for two years until
        Itachi is promoted to a new Anbu team under Danzō's authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Itachi's accomplishments were a source of great pride for his family, his father viewing him as proof of the
        Uchiha's future prosperity and his brother viewing him as a model to live up to. Itachi spent a great deal of
        time with Sasuke, training with him (though rarely actually training him) and giving him the recognition their
        father did not. However, for all the attention he received, few truly understood Itachi, believing his isolation
        to be a result of the gap between his abilities and theirs and not his dissatisfaction with the shinobi's life
        of conflict. Eventually, the Uchiha's disdain for their unfair treatment led them to plan a coup d'état. Fugaku,
        head of the Uchiha and the coup's chief conspirator, encouraged Itachi's advancement into the Anbu's ranks as a
        means of spying on the village. Itachi, however, knew an Uchiha coup would lead to intervention from other
        villages and ultimately start another World War, something he could not support. He instead became a double
        agent, reporting the Uchiha's actions to the Third Hokage and the Konoha Council in the hopes it would help them
        find a peaceful resolution.

      </p>


      <p>
        Itachi shared the burden of betraying his clan with Shisui. But as time went on it became increasingly clear
        that peace could not be achieved. Shisui intended to use his Kotoamatsukami on the Uchiha's leaders to compel
        them to negotiate, but his right eye was stolen by Danzō before he had a chance. His own options exhausted,
        Shisui entrusted his remaining eye to Itachi and begged him to protect the village and their family name before
        drowning himself in the Naka River. Itachi was anguished by Shisui's death, enough to awaken his Mangekyō
        Sharingan. When the following day some Uchiha, already suspicious of Itachi, accused him of murdering Shisui and
        staging a suicide, Itachi lost his composure and attacked them, defeating them easily. A rift was created
        between Itachi and his family, and his warnings to them to reconsider what they were doing fell on deaf ears. At
        age 12, he was promoted to Anbu Captain, with his publicly disclosed promotion age being 13 due to Danzō's
        request and Hiruzen's acceptance. In the anime, Itachi was also given command of his own three-man squad. At one
        point, Itachi would confront his father in the Naka Shrine basement, who revealed to have had his own Mangekyō
        Sharingan since the Third Shinobi World War. Having read the Stone Tablet with it and knowing the truth of its
        power, Fugaku calls for Itachi's aid in a bloodless revolution by restraining the higher-ups in lieu of
        controlling the Nine-Tailed Fox much of the clan's favour of bloodshed. Instead, Itachi would return back to the
        Konoha Council to report the clan's imminent revolt.

      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Third Hokage still wished to negotiate with the Uchiha, Danzō Shimura recognised that there was no
        longer an outcome that could see the Uchiha clan's survival. He explained this to Itachi and left him a choice:
        support the Uchiha's coup and have the whole clan, including Sasuke, killed in the ensuing conflict, or accept
        the assignment to wipe out the clan before the coup started and be allowed to spare Sasuke. Itachi chose his
        brother. Despite having made his choice, Itachi was tormented by guilt, especially with the knowledge that
        Shisui would most likely not forgive his choice to destroy the clan. However, remembering the words of his
        father to not let other's decide things for his life, he resolved to continue his path. While making final
        preparations, Itachi discovered a masked man sneaking around Konoha. From observing him, he came to believe the
        man was truly Madara Uchiha bent on provoking some new conflict. Itachi approached him with an offer: he would
        assist "Madara" with wiping out the Uchiha, taking vengeance against them for abandoning him decades earlier, if
        Madara would spare the village, to which he agreed.

      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Uchiha_Clan_massacre.webp" alt="">
        In one night Itachi and Tobi slaughtered the entire clan. Itachi took it upon himself to personally execute his
        parents. Despite his betrayal, they bore him no ill-will, instead telling him in the moments before they were
        killed that they were proud of him and requesting that he take care of Sasuke. Racked by grief for his actions,
        Itachi saw in Sasuke the only person suitable to punish him for his crimes. In order to set Sasuke on this road
        he cast himself as the villain, done by allowing Sasuke to find him standing over their parents' bodies and
        using Tsukuyomi to torment him with visions of their murders. Sasuke fled, fearing his own death, but Itachi
        chased him down to divulge the lie he had concocted: he killed their family to test his mettle and now wanted to
        test himself against the only remaining challenge to him, the little brother he had never loved. He encouraged
        Sasuke to become strong enough to kill him and take revenge, and to that end suggested he acquire a Mangekyō
        Sharingan of his own. Itachi left, but was surprised to find Sasuke already pursuing him with a newly-awakened
        Sharingan. Sasuke's attempt at vengeance failed and he passed out, but not before seeing Itachi cry with
        remorse.

      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, he disguised a crow clone as a member of Root to threaten Danzō he would leak Konoha's secrets to
        enemy villages if he touched Sasuke, having realised Danzō could not be trusted to keep his promises. For his
        final business in the village, Itachi visited the Third Hokage and reported his mission completed, much to the
        Third's surprise and disappointment. Itachi requested that the Third look after Sasuke, which the Third vowed to
        do. Itachi left the village publicly a traitor but secretly with a new mission: to infiltrate Tobi's
        organisation, Akatsuki, and keep it from moving against Konoha. In the anime, Itachi was ambushed by his former
        Anbu squad under orders from Danzō, only to trick them into killing each other using genjutsu. At some point
        after joining Akatsuki, he was initially partnered up with Jūzō Biwa. While growing accustomed to his new
        setting and working well with his partner, the duo was eventually given a mission in the Land of Water. After
        completing it, they were ambushed by a hunter-nin squad led by Yagura. While initially pressed by the perfect
        jinchūriki, Itachi was able to defeat him with Amaterasu, but not before Jūzō was slain.

      </p>

      <p>
        Sometime later, Orochimaru tried to steal Itachi's body in order to gain the Sharingan, but Itachi easily
        overpowered him, trapping him inside a paralysis genjutsu and severing his left hand to prevent him from
        dispelling it. In the anime, Itachi expressed his disgust at Orochimaru for his inhumane experiments and was
        about to kill him when Kabuto saved Orochimaru but they were both forced to leave Akatsuki. Later, Itachi was
        partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki, with whom he bonded over their shared notoriety for killing their own
        countrymen. To find a replacement for Orochimaru, Itachi helped recruit Deidara, whose art he defeated with his
        Sharingan's genjutsu; Deidara would forever after swear vengeance for the humiliating defeat. In the anime,
        Itachi also aided in the recruitment of Hidan. Pain eventually caught wind of Orochimaru's attempt to destroy
        Konoha and requested a team to investigate, which Itachi immediately volunteered for out of concern for Sasuke's
        safety.

      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, Itachi contracted a terminal illness. He kept himself alive through the years with medicine and
        sheer willpower so that he could live long enough to die by Sasuke's hand.

      </p>
      <h2>
        Personality

      </h2>
      <p>
        From a young age, Itachi was calm and insightful, showing noticeable maturity for his age and knowledge on how
        to deal with every situation. For all his accomplishments, talent, and fame, Itachi was a rather humble man.
        Never arrogant about his own abilities nor underestimating others, most things he said would be unbiased and
        accurate. If an opponent exceeded his expectations or posed a legitimate challenge to him or his allies, Itachi
        would freely admit it. As a seven-year-old, his reasoning was on par with a Hokage. Having studied history, not
        just of his clan or his village but of the world, he gained a broader appreciation of what was important.
        Learning so much enabled him to understand how events of the past came to happen and, when he applied that same
        understanding into the future, he became concerned for where things were going. At the same time, Itachi was
        still fairly naïve as a child in many real-world scenarios and as such was willing to learn from his peers on
        how to differentiate situations. He lived at a distance, observing individuals and ideas without getting
        directly involved so that he could fully understand them.

      </p>
      <p>
        Although this approach prevented him from becoming close with many people, it enabled him to think and act
        without prejudice or preconceptions, instead evaluating things strictly on their own merits. In the anime,
        Itachi unintentionally gained many friends and admirers for his genuine concern for others despite his passive
        nature. He would think about shinobi and origins of the village and its future. For this reason, he never became
        arrogant about his own abilities or accomplishments; to which, most views or statements he made were usually
        well-based, seeing the situation for what it was. From this he had no self-righteous loyalty to his clan that
        was so common among the Uchiha; though he loved his family and wanted the best for them, he knew there were more
        important things than the Uchiha's personal aspirations. Itachi's dream was to become Hokage, though he kept it
        hidden from others. Itachi was also one of the few villagers of Konoha to hold no grudge against Naruto Uzumaki,
        believing Naruto to be the greatest victim of the Nine-Tails attack and showed him kindness whenever they met by
        chance.

      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Itachi_cries.webp" alt="">
        A pacifist at heart, Itachi did not actually like fighting and would avoid it when he could. When he couldn't,
        he would end the fight as quickly as possible, all the while holding himself back as much as possible. Despite
        this, Itachi felt his own needs were secondary to the greater good's and to that end he became a shinobi. He
        trained tirelessly to improve himself as quickly as he could and subjected himself to all of the shinobi life's
        inconveniences without complaint for the simple motivation of being useful to others. His commitment borderlined
        recklessness, due to training privately using extremely deadly methods such as dodging a barrage of kunai in the
        anime. Being so accomplished as a ninja enabled Itachi to approach problems less violently than others would,
        satisfying his peace-loving nature. These two extremes of his personality came into conflict as events moved
        toward the Uchiha Clan Downfall; he did not want to harm his family and sought a peaceful resolution, but knew
        that the path with the least bloodshed would be the clan's extermination. When the Uchiha Clan refused to deter
        from their plans, Itachi was pushed over the edge and his normally polite attitude to his clansmen became more
        violent, criticising them openly and lashing out at them for the choices that sealed their fates and his own.
        Despite his natural pacifism and kindness, Itachi was possessed of a wrathful and merciless side when those he
        loved were hurt or threatened. In revenge for Yashiro Uchiha's cowardly manipulations of his father from the
        shadows and helping to provoke war against Konohagakure while keeping free of responsibility himself, Itachi
        used his Tsukuyomi to force him to experience days of torture in an instant after making him realise how weak he
        was in comparison to Itachi himself. Itachi would later use Tsukuyomi, followed by Amaterasu to execute the
        helpless Root member Sugaru in revenge for Sugaru poisoning Shisui.

      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the traumas he endured from killing his own family, Itachi did not blame those among Konoha's leadership
        who gave him the mission; though he did not trust Danzō on a personal level, he knew Danzō only had the
        village's best interests at heart. But Itachi – partly out of the necessity of his assignment to join Akatsuki –
        was greatly changed after the massacre, rarely if ever showing emotion. He became more prone to displays of
        force and permitted certain violent habits of his partner, Kisame, under the pretence that it furthered
        Akatsuki's goals. After learning from Hiruzen everything that Itachi endured, Hashirama considered him a greater
        shinobi than himself. Itachi could not and would not fully shake his pacifistic ways, and would run from
        confrontation or rein in Kisame if the likelihood of collateral damage became too high for themselves or others.
        In addition, Itachi would continue to show his morality at times, as he expressed disgust at Orochimaru's lack
        of care for human life. While Kisame would sometimes protest, he considered Itachi a good friend and would
        listen to his instructions. Itachi also had a decent partnership with his previous partner Jūzō, showing respect
        to him and after his death, placing the remains of Kubikiribōchō in Jūzō's hand.

      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Itachi_pokes_Sasuke.webp" alt="">
        Konoha's peace and protection was always forefront in Itachi's mind, but it was his dedication to his brother,
        Sasuke, that took priority in every situation. From the time of Sasuke's infancy, Itachi tasked himself with
        looking after him. In the anime, Itachi even correctly guessed Sasuke's gender before his younger brother's
        birth. They'd spend whole days together in the woods around Konoha having adventures and accomplishing
        self-appointed missions. When Itachi became an accomplished ninja and took much of their father's attention,
        Itachi would make special time to fill their father's shoes for Sasuke's benefit, at times even refusing his
        father's wishes in order to make Sasuke happy. In turn Sasuke wished to be just like his older brother and would
        often ask Itachi to train him in the ninja arts. Itachi would almost never do so, poking his forehead and
        promising to train him some other time. Unfortunately, none of these promises were ever kept.

      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Itachi_crying.webp" alt="">
        It was Sasuke's safety that ultimately convinced Itachi to go through with killing the rest of the Uchiha,
        believing his own damnation was worth it if it ensured Sasuke's survival. Even though he did it for Sasuke,
        Itachi wanted to be punished for his crimes and selected Sasuke as the one to take vengeance against him. To
        push Sasuke in this direction, Itachi withheld the true reason for his actions and instead took on the persona
        of a man who had no love for his younger brother. Per the persona, Itachi cared about Sasuke only because of the
        eyes that he could take to gain Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan. His actions in Akatsuki were meant to reinforce this
        persona, and whenever he met Sasuke over the years he would taunt his weakness and encourage him to get strong
        enough to kill him. His plan was that, once he had been killed, Sasuke would be hailed as a hero. Itachi never
        wanted Sasuke to learn the truth surrounding the Uchiha's massacre, and if he did he hoped the memory of a
        hateful older brother would cause him to not believe it. Itachi's constant pursuit of peace, coupled with the
        paramount secrecy of his missions and his capacity to care about those around him, led Itachi to take on every
        burden himself, believing he needed no help from comrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        After he died and was reincarnated, Itachi discovers that his plans largely failed; Sasuke is not a hero, he did
        find out the truth about what Itachi did, and now he aims to destroy Konoha for its role in Itachi and the
        Uchiha clan's suffering. He then begins to see the flaw in his original plans: he had been trying to manipulate
        Sasuke rather than be honest with him and trust in his own strength. Acknowledging the mistakes, Itachi is free
        to be himself instead of the persona he fabricated, being openly kind to others and displaying a dry sense of
        humour even in stressful situations. He puts his trust in Naruto Uzumaki to stop Sasuke from proceeding further
        down the path of darkness, and after Naruto proclaims that he will stop the war himself, warns Naruto against
        forgetting the value of his friends like he himself and "Madara" did, reminding him how those he loved helped
        him come so far. Itachi later even shows empathy to his enemy Kabuto Yakushi, likening Kabuto's arrogance and
        belief in nothing being beyond him to Itachi's own living self, telling him that such a path can only lead to
        failure, at the same time seeing finally acknowledging his true self for who he is and forgiving himself for his
        mistakes. Itachi further displays a reflective side, refusing Sasuke's claims that he was perfect and telling
        him that perfection can never be obtained by one individual. Itachi came to believe sometimes two people of
        completely opposite personalities are two sides of the same coin; that when they learn to work together, they
        can succeed in things they are unable to accomplish alone, a possible reference to how he and Kisame were
        complete opposites but were capable of compensating for each other's weaknesses. He is also finally open and
        honest with Sasuke during their final meeting, admitting what he did and even sharing information Sasuke did not
        already know. He apologises to Sasuke for failing in his responsibilities as an older brother, wondering if
        being up front with Sasuke from the beginning might have allowed them to avoid the Uchiha's destruction. In
        their final moments together, Itachi tells Sasuke he does not need forgiveness and that he will always love him
        no matter what.

      </p>
      <h2>
        Appearance
      </h2>
      <p>
        Itachi was a fairly tall man of fair complexion. He had black eyes, under which were long, pronounced
        tear-troughs. He had jet-black hair that was pulled back in a low ponytail and his face was framed with
        centre-parted bangs that extended to his chin; the ponytail and bangs grew longer over the years. His overall
        appearance is very similar to Sasuke's. Even more, like his brother, he was considered very handsome as
        many girls became infatuated with him.When he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes consisted of a black shirt
        with the Uchiha clan symbol on the back, bandages around his ankles, and black sandals. He wore tan pants with a
        weapons pouch strapped to his back. When on duty, he would wear the standard Anbu uniform complete with arm
        guards, a flak jacket, and a porcelain mask which was fashioned to resemble a weasel with a red, triangular
        marking on top.

      <p>

        As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the standard Akatsuki cloak and a slashed Konoha forehead protector to
        symbolise his broken ties with the village. The cloak's high collar would obscure his ponytail. He would
        sometimes unbutton his cloak to mid-chest and rest his left arm there, rather than in the sleeve. Under his
        cloak he wore clothes similar to the rest of Akatsuki: mesh armour with navy accents under an identical T-shirt
        with a simple white belt around the waist and dark blue pants. On his right ring finger was his Akatsuki ring,
        which was red and bore the kanji for "vermilion" (朱, shu). He wore light blue nail polish on his fingers and
        toes and a necklace that had three silver rings with red gems inside them.

        After being reincarnated by Kabuto with the Impure World Reincarnation technique, he was seen wearing a maroon
        long sleeved cloak like the other reincarnated ninjas and retains his dark blue pants and black open-toed
        sandals. His skin becomes pale white with linings on his face, his hair became dark grey and has soulless onyx
        eyes minus the irides.

      <h1>Abilities of ITACHI</h1>
      <h2>Mangekyō Sharingan</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Phoenix_Sage_Flower_Nail_Crimson.webp" alt="">
        Itachi awakened the Mangekyō Sharingan after witnessing Shisui's suicide. Its design was three spiralling curves
        around the pupil. With both eyes, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that trapped opponents' minds in an
        illusory world, altering their perception of time. With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, igniting
        whatever he looked at with black flames that would burn anything, including fire itself. He had the ability to
        extinguish Amaterasu.
      </p>
      <h2>Chakra and Physical Prowess
      </h2>
      <p>
        As an Uchiha, Itachi's chakra was naturally strong, it is unknown how his actual reserves were affected by his
        terminal illness. Just three uses of his Mangekyō Sharingan in a single day made him unable to use his Sharingan
        and he would require significant rest afterwards to regain his strength. This also prevented him from
        participating in prolonged battles.

      </p>
      <p>Although not his preferred method of combat, Itachi was very skilled with taijutsu – enough to easily defeat
        three members of the Konoha Military Police Force at the age of 11. He had exceptional speed and reflexes,
        able to compete with Shisui, who was well-famed for his own speed. His quickness was particularly noted with his
        hand movements, able to make hand seals too fast to be perceived normally; even skilled Sharingan-users had
        difficulty following him. His speed could move great distances in an instant as if by displacing
        himself, giving his opponent little chance to react or initiate a counter-attack.Itachi also showed
        remarkable fortitude. Despite spending years afflicted with a crippling disease, he was able to maintain his
        composure at all times and still battle at near-perfect form. Itachi set the record for completing the Forest of
        Death in his Chūnin Exams while still 9 years old, at 5 hours and 37 minutes, while taking the exams solo.
        He could use chakra to enhance his strikes.</p>
      <h2>Ninjutsu</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Crow_Clone.PNG.webp" alt="">
        Itachi could summon crows, which he would typically call forth in flocks to swarm opponents and distract them.
        He even integrated crows into clones of himself that would draw opponents' attacks. He was likewise able to
        create shadow clones and from which could lure in opponents before exploding. Itachi was also well-versed in
        fūinjutsu, particularly those that would activate in the presence of a specific person's Sharingan. From
        his time in Anbu, Itachi became proficient in stealth, infiltration, and assassination</p>
      <h2>Bukijutsu</h2>
      <p>
        As a fully-trained Konoha Anbu, Itachi was skilled with a sword, which was his primary weapon during the Uchiha
        Clan Downfall. Like many Uchiha, he specialised in shurikenjutsu, which he was especially advanced at. Even as a
        child, Itachi could perfectly hit an intricate set of eight targets, one of which was hidden in a blind spot, by
        accurately deflecting his projectile off another one to redirect both projectiles' path in mid-air. His
        throwing speed was imperceptible, enough to negate the advantages of the Summoning: Lightning Flash Blade
        Creation. He was equally comfortable with kunai, able to use them to spar with opponents wielding swords. In
        the anime, he learned advanced sleight-of-hand from Shisui to give his opponents even less time to react
      </p>
      <h2>Genjutsu</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Tsukuyomi.webp" alt=""> Consistent with his pacifist nature, Itachi specialised in genjutsu, where the illusions would typically
        involve crows. Regarded as one of Konohagakure's best users, even without the aid of his Sharingan, his
        illusions have remarkable potency, able to seamlessly affect his targets without them realising it, while on
        guard, and also perform them by merely pointing at his target. He is noted by Ao to have such high prowess that
        he could use genjutsu to control other individuals outside the range of even the Sensor Division. Itachi
        could also use genjutsu to share information or psychologically disable opponents, letting him end the fight
        instantly.</p>
        <h2>Susanoo</h2>
        <p>
          <img src="imgs/Susanoo.webp" alt="">
          Having awakened the Mangekyō in both his eyes, Itachi could also use Susanoo. With its simplest manifestations, he could produce extra arms or bones to improve his options in a fight. When used in full, Itachi was surrounded by a spectral warrior that would protect him from damage. In addition to the chakra swords and Yasaka Magatama common to all Susanoo, Itachi's Susanoo wielded the Sword of Totsuka – an ethereal sword with the ability to seal any person it pierced into its gourd—hilt – and the Yata Mirror – a shield that was said to reflect any attack by changing its chakra nature to counterbalance an attack. The simultaneous use of both weapons made Itachi's Susanoo essentially invincible.</p>
      <h2>Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="imgs/Itachi_Using_Genjutsu.webp" alt="">
        Itachi was a highly intelligent individual, having the second highest scores in the history of the Chūnin Exams
        written test behind Minato Namikaze. Composed and observant; he thought very quickly and remained calm in a
        fight, enabling him to respond with maximum efficiency and with the smallest likelihood of misjudging
        circumstances. Even at a young age, he was always calculating and methodical in his approach to the situation at
        hand, leaving little room for error. He took several precautions for Sasuke and against Tobi that he planned
        would activate after his death. Even Tobi admitted if he didn't keep some secrets from Itachi, he would have
        been killed by Itachi's trap. During his infiltration of Konoha, Itachi was also able to subtly leak
        Akatsuki's goals to Kakashi, Kurenai, Asuma, and Jiraiya without arousing Kisame's suspicions.
